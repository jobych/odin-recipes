    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
            Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li><h4>Step 3</h4>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
